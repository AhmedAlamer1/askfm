# askfm
first oop project with C++.


This is a C++ project that allows users to ask, answer and delete questions.


I tried to use some of topics of oop.

# project features :
- sign up or sign in
* show questions I asked
+ show questions I recieved
- ask a new question
* respond to a question
+ delete a question
- list all the users in the system
- list all the questions in the system
 
<h2>
        NOTE
</h2>


-The project still needs a lot of exception handling. (sorry for that)



-Username consists from one string with no spaces.


-It uses files to store questions ,answers and users.


  

<h2>
I will be thankful to U if you do that:
</h2>

-you can tell me what percent of using opp in the project.

-suggest features with some hint to do it(preferred).
