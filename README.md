# askfm
first oop project with C++.

I tried to use some of topics of oop.

This is a C++ project that allows users to ask, answer and delete questions. 

NOTE

-The project still needs a lot of exception handling. (sorry for that)
-Username consists from one string with no spaces.
It uses files to store questions ,answers and users.
  
I will be thankful to U if you do that:
-you can tell me what percent of using opp in the project.
-tell me about any bugs that may be face you during testing.
-suggest features with some hint to do it(preferred).
